## What is it for ?

One of our Swiss army knife toolset: **Redprint Wizard UI**. It is a code generator/ interactive developer playground. It supports a space to experience, innovate and build features that either lie far along ether Optimism or Ethereum 's roadmaps which aren't yet available on the production at all, empowering developers to dream, tinker, and push the boundaries of what's possible by composing their own different OPStack components together.

Together with [`redprint-forge`](https://github.com/Ratimon/redprint-forge), it does not only help novice developers to deploy OPStack's smart contracts to deploy on OP mainnet, but also help them to use generated deployment script in their own projects.
